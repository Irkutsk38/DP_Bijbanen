NON of this is my work. I just updated all reletad resources and made them working. Feel free to use.

If you already have the latest version of es_extended: https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended

This version of es_extended with the Jobs edit will allow you to add the jobs pole jobs in Double job without having to take your head for hours to embed the lines in es_extend if you have no knowledge in DEV.

To install it:
- Replace your es_extended with my versions.

- Add secondary trades to your Resources folder.

- Add SQL: esx_doublejob.sql to your database.

- Edit your server.cfg:
```
start esx_jobssecondary
start esx_joblistingsecondary
start esx_truckerjobsecondary
start esx_gopostalsecondary
start esx_garbagesecondary 
start esx_marathonjobsecondary 
start esx_gardenersecondary 
start esx_poolcleanersecondary 
start esx_cityworkssecondary
```

- If you do not have the basic versions of different trades think to add their SQl file also in your BDD.

Start your server and enjoy the double job only on job pole jobs.

I would try to keep it up to date with the different Updates from es_extended.
